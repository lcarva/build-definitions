# Migration from 0.2 to 0.3

Task `summary` can, optionally, list information about the source container image built in by the
Pipeline. To do so, set the `source-image-url` parameter to be the value of the `SOURCE_IMAGE_URL`
result from the `source-build` Task.

This was previously done by inspecting a certain file in the workspace. This is no longer needed
and usage of the workspace can be removed.

Apply the following diff to task `show-summary` in the PipelineRun YAMLs generated by Konflux bot.

```diff
         value: $(params.output-image)
       - name: build-task-status
         value: $(tasks.build-container.status)
+      - name: source-image-url
+        value: $(tasks.build-source-image.results.SOURCE_IMAGE_URL)
-      workspaces:
-      - name: workspace
-        workspace: workspace
   results:
     - name: IMAGE_URL
       value: "$(tasks.build-container.results.IMAGE_URL)"
```

This update to the PipelineRun is optional. The build pipeline can run normally without the mount.
