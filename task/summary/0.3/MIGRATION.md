# Migration from 0.1 to 0.2

Task `summary` can be optionally mounted to the shared workspace in order to show source container image URL. Apply the following diff to task `show-summary` in the PipelineRun YAMLs generated by Konflux bot.

```diff
         value: $(params.output-image)
       - name: build-task-status
         value: $(tasks.build-container.status)
+      workspaces:
+      - name: workspace
+        workspace: workspace
   results:
     - name: IMAGE_URL
       value: "$(tasks.build-container.results.IMAGE_URL)"
```

This update to the PipelineRun is optional. The build pipeline can run normally without the mount.
